    How are these papers linked together 

        Common Theme: Graph-Based and Advanced Retrieval Techniques Each paper explores
        different facets of improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency by introducing novel structures or frameworks:

        LADR explores the use of latent features and approximation techniques to improve the retrieval process.

        Adaptive Re-ranking with a Corpus Graph (Gar) introduces a graph-based method to dynamically adjust rankings based on a
        corpus graph, enhancing the relevance of retrieved documents.

        Adhoc Retrieval through Traversal of a Query-Document Graph investigates the use of a graph that includes both queries
        and documents to potentially improve retrieval outcomes through strategic traversal methods. Methodological Innovations

        All three papers push the boundaries of conventional retrieval methods:

        LADR challenges traditional approximation techniques with a potentially more effective and efficient method.

        Gar employs a corpus graph, which adapatively re-ranks documents based on additional contextual relationships within the
        corpus.

        Traversal of a Query-Document Graph suggests that direct interaction between queries and documents via graph traversal
        could yield better retrieval results than isolated query-document evaluations.

        Enhanced Retrieval Metrics Each study focuses on evaluating and improving key retrieval metrics like precision, recall,
        and nDCG:

        LADR is assessed on its effectiveness and efficiency, likely impacting metrics such as nDCG and precision.

        Gar is evaluated through its impact on retrieval effectiveness, comparing its performance with traditional re-ranking
        and advanced neural IR systems.

        Traversal of a Query-Document Graph addresses the impact on retrieval metrics through unique graph traversal techniques,
        offering potential improvements in precision and recall.

        Potential for Future Research Integration The insights and methods from each paper could be integrated into a
        comprehensive retrieval system:

        Techniques from LADR could be combined with the graph-based approaches of Gar and Traversal of a Query-Document Graph to
        develop a highly sophisticated IR system that uses both latent features and graph structures. The adaptive re-ranking
        methods of Gar could benefit from the dynamic traversal methods explored in the Traversal of a Query-Document Graph,
        potentially enhancing the adaptiveness and contextual awareness of the re-ranking process.

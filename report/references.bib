abstract = {Retrieval approaches that score documents based on learned dense vectors (i.e., dense retrieval) rather than lexical signals (i.e., conventional retrieval) are increasingly popular. Their ability to identify related documents that do not necessarily contain the same terms as those appearing in the user's query (thereby improving recall) is one of their key advantages. However, to actually achieve these gains, dense retrieval approaches typically require an exhaustive search over the document collection, making them considerably more expensive at query-time than conventional lexical approaches. Several techniques aim to reduce this computational overhead by approximating the results of a full dense retriever. Although these approaches reasonably approximate the top results, they suffer in terms of recall -- one of the key advantages of dense retrieval. We introduce 'LADR' (Lexically-Accelerated Dense Retrieval), a simple-yet-effective approach that improves the efficiency of existing dense retrieval models without compromising on retrieval effectiveness. LADR uses lexical retrieval techniques to seed a dense retrieval exploration that uses a document proximity graph. Through extensive experiments, we find that LADR establishes a new dense retrieval effectiveness-efficiency Pareto frontier among approximate k nearest neighbor techniques. When tuned to take around 8ms per query in retrieval latency on our hardware, LADR consistently achieves both precision and recall that are on par with an exhaustive search on standard benchmarks. Importantly, LADR accomplishes this using only a single CPU -- no hardware accelerators such as GPUs -- which reduces the deployment cost of dense retrieval systems.},

title="Effective Adhoc Retrieval Through Traversal of a Query-Document Graph",
booktitle="Advances in Information Retrieval",
abstract="Adhoc retrieval is the task of effectively retrieving information for an end-user's information need, usually expressed as a textual query. One of the most well-established retrieval frameworks is the two-stage retrieval pipeline, whereby an inexpensive retrieval algorithm retrieves a subset of candidate documents from a corpus, and a more sophisticated (but costly) model re-ranks these candidates. A notable limitation of this two-stage framework is that the second stage re-ranking model can only re-order documents, and any relevant documents not retrieved from the corpus in the first stage are entirely lost to the second stage. A recently-proposed Adaptive Re-Ranking technique has shown that extending the candidate pool by traversing a document similarity graph can overcome this recall problem. However, this traversal technique is agnostic of the user's query, which has the potential to waste compute resources by scoring documents that are not related to the query. In this work, we propose an alternative formulation of the document similarity graph. Rather than using document similarities, we propose a weighted bipartite graph that consists of both document nodes and query nodes. This overcomes the limitations of prior Adaptive Re-Ranking approaches because the bipartite graph can be navigated in a manner that explicitly acknowledges the original user query issued to the search pipeline. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by experimenting with the TREC Deep Learning track in a standard adhoc retrieval setting. We find that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage re-ranking pipelines, improving the nDCG@10 metric by 5.8{\%} on the DL19 test collection."

abstract = {Search systems often employ a re-ranking pipeline, wherein documents (or passages) from an initial pool of candidates are assigned new ranking scores. The process enables the use of highly-effective but expensive scoring functions that are not suitable for use directly in structures like inverted indices or approximate nearest neighbour indices. However, re-ranking pipelines are inherently limited by the recall of the initial candidate pool; documents that are not identified as candidates for re-ranking by the initial retrieval function cannot be identified. We propose a novel approach for overcoming the recall limitation based on the well-established clustering hypothesis. Throughout the re-ranking process, our approach adds documents to the pool that are most similar to the highest-scoring documents up to that point. This feedback process adapts the pool of candidates to those that may also yield high ranking scores, even if they were not present in the initial pool. It can also increase the score of documents that appear deeper in the pool that would have otherwise been skipped due to a limited re-ranking budget. We find that our Graph-based Adaptive Re-ranking (GAR) approach significantly improves the performance of re-ranking pipelines in terms of precision- and recall-oriented measures, is complementary to a variety of existing techniques (e.g., dense retrieval), is robust to its hyperparameters, and contributes minimally to computational and storage costs. For instance, on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, GAR can improve the nDCG of a BM25 candidate pool by up to 8\% when applying a monoT5 ranker.},

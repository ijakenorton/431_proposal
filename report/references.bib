 abstract = {Search systems often employ a re-ranking pipeline, wherein
             documents (or passages) from an initial pool of candidates are
             assigned new ranking scores. The process enables the use of
             highly-effective but expensive scoring functions that are not
             suitable for use directly in structures like inverted indices or
             approximate nearest neighbour indices. However, re-ranking pipelines
             are inherently limited by the recall of the initial candidate pool;
             documents that are not identified as candidates for re-ranking by
             the initial retrieval function cannot be identified. We propose a
             novel approach for overcoming the recall limitation based on the
             well-established clustering hypothesis. Throughout the re-ranking
             process, our approach adds documents to the pool that are most
             similar to the highest-scoring documents up to that point. This
             feedback process adapts the pool of candidates to those that may
             also yield high ranking scores, even if they were not present in the
             initial pool. It can also increase the score of documents that
             appear deeper in the pool that would have otherwise been skipped due
             to a limited re-ranking budget. We find that our Graph-based
             Adaptive Re-ranking (GAR) approach significantly improves the
             performance of re-ranking pipelines in terms of precision- and
             recall-oriented measures, is complementary to a variety of existing
             techniques (e.g., dense retrieval), is robust to its hyperparameters
             , and contributes minimally to computational and storage costs. For
             instance, on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, GAR can improve
             the nDCG of a BM25 candidate pool by up to 8\% when applying a
             monoT5 ranker.},

 abstract = {Retrieval approaches that score documents based on learned dense
             vectors (i.e., dense retrieval) rather than lexical signals (i.e.,
             conventional retrieval) are increasingly popular. Their ability to
             identify related documents that do not necessarily contain the same
             terms as those appearing in the user's query (thereby improving
             recall) is one of their key advantages. However, to actually achieve
             these gains, dense retrieval approaches typically require an
             exhaustive search over the document collection, making them
             considerably more expensive at query-time than conventional lexical
             approaches. Several techniques aim to reduce this computational
             overhead by approximating the results of a full dense retriever.
             Although these approaches reasonably approximate the top results,
             they suffer in terms of recall -- one of the key advantages of dense
             retrieval. We introduce 'LADR' (Lexically-Accelerated Dense
             Retrieval), a simple-yet-effective approach that improves the
             efficiency of existing dense retrieval models without compromising
             on retrieval effectiveness. LADR uses lexical retrieval techniques
             to seed a dense retrieval exploration that uses a document proximity
             graph. Through extensive experiments, we find that LADR establishes
             a new dense retrieval effectiveness-efficiency Pareto frontier among
             approximate k nearest neighbor techniques. When tuned to take around
             8ms per query in retrieval latency on our hardware, LADR
             consistently achieves both precision and recall that are on par with
             an exhaustive search on standard benchmarks. Importantly, LADR
             accomplishes this using only a single CPU -- no hardware
             accelerators such as GPUs -- which reduces the deployment cost of
             dense retrieval systems.},

 title = {Effective Adhoc Retrieval Through Traversal of a Query-Document Graph},
 booktitle = {Advances in Information Retrieval},
 abstract = {Adhoc retrieval is the task of effectively retrieving information
             for an end-user's information need, usually expressed as a textual
             query. One of the most well-established retrieval frameworks is the
             two-stage retrieval pipeline, whereby an inexpensive retrieval
             algorithm retrieves a subset of candidate documents from a corpus,
             and a more sophisticated (but costly) model re-ranks these
             candidates. A notable limitation of this two-stage framework is that
             the second stage re-ranking model can only re-order documents, and
             any relevant documents not retrieved from the corpus in the first
             stage are entirely lost to the second stage. A recently-proposed
             Adaptive Re-Ranking technique has shown that extending the candidate
             pool by traversing a document similarity graph can overcome this
             recall problem. However, this traversal technique is agnostic of the
             user's query, which has the potential to waste compute resources by
             scoring documents that are not related to the query. In this work,
             we propose an alternative formulation of the document similarity
             graph. Rather than using document similarities, we propose a
             weighted bipartite graph that consists of both document nodes and
             query nodes. This overcomes the limitations of prior Adaptive
             Re-Ranking approaches because the bipartite graph can be navigated
             in a manner that explicitly acknowledges the original user query
             issued to the search pipeline. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
             proposed framework by experimenting with the TREC Deep Learning
             track in a standard adhoc retrieval setting. We find that our
             approach outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage re-ranking pipelines
             , improving the nDCG@10 metric by 5.8{\%} on the DL19 test
             collection.},
